# How to setup the Masters using `kubeadm` bootstrap

Master components provide the cluster’s control plane. Master components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), and detecting and responding to cluster events (starting up a new pod when a replication controller’s ‘replicas’ field is unsatisfied).

Master components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However, for simplicity, setup scripts typically start all master components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine.

## Overview

</p>

## Components

* **Kubelet** - Kubelet gets the configuration of a pod from the API Server and ensures that the described containers are up and running.
* **Docker** - It takes care of downloading the images and starting the containers.
* **etcd** - The etcd reliably stores the configuration data of the Kubernetes cluster, representing the state of the cluster (what nodes exist in the cluster, what pods should be running, which nodes they are running on, and a whole lot more) at any given point in time.
* **API Server** - The API Server validates and configures data for the API objects, which include pods, services, replication controllers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster’s shared state through which all other components interact.
* **Controller Manager** - The Controller Manager watches the state of the cluster through the API Server watch feature and, when it gets notified, it makes the necessary changes, attempting to move the current state towards the desired state. Besides, the Controller Manager performs lifecycle of as namespace, event, terminated-pod, cascading-deletion, node, etc.
* **Scheduler** - The Scheduler watches for unscheduled pods and binds them to nodes via the binding pod subresource API, according to the availability of the requested resources, quality of service requirements, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, and other constraints. Once the pod has a node assigned, the regular behavior of the Kubelet is triggered and the pod and its containers are created.
* **Kube Proxy** - Kube Proxy acts as a network proxy and a load balancer for a service on a single worker node. It takes care of the network routing for TCP and UDP packets.
* **Flannel** - It is a layer 3 network fabric designed for Kubernetes. Check our [previous topic about flannel](kube-flannel.md) for more information.
* **CoreDNS** - It is the DNS Server of the Kubernetes cluster. For more information, check the [CoreDNS official repository](https://github.com/coredns/coredns).


## Create the VMs

To initialize and configure our instances using cloud-init, we'll use the configuration files versioned at the data directory from our repository.

Notice we also make use of our `create-image.sh` helper script, passing some files from inside the `data/kube/` directory as parameters.

* **Create the Masters**

  ```console
  ~/kubernetes-under-the-hood$ for instance in kube-mast01 kube-mast02 kube-mast03; do
      ./create-image.sh \
          -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
          -u kube/user-data \
          -n kube-mast/network-config \
          -i kube-mast/post-config-interfaces \
          -r kube-mast/post-config-resources \
          -o ${instance} \
          -l debian \
          -b debian-base-image
  done
  ```

  **Parameters:**

  * **`-k`** is used to copy the **public key** from your host to the newly created VM.
  * **`-u`** is used to specify the **user-data** file that will be passed as a parameter to the command that creates the cloud-init ISO file we mentioned before (check the source code of the script for a better understanding of how it's used). Default is **`/data/user-data`**.
  * **`-m`** is used to specify the **meta-data** file that will be passed as a parameter to the command that creates the cloud-init ISO file we mentioned before (check the source code of the script for a better understanding of how it's used). Default is **`/data/meta-data`**.
  * **`-n`** is used to pass a configuration file that will be used by cloud-init to configure the **network** for the instance.
  * **`-i`** is used to pass a configuration file that our script will use to modify the **network interface** managed by **VirtualBox** that is attached to the instance that will be created from this image.
  * **`-r`** is used to pass a configuration file that our script will use to configure the **number of processors and amount of memory** that is allocated to our instance by **VirtualBox**.
  * **`-o`** is used to pass the **hostname** that will be assigned to our instance. This will also be the name used by **VirtualBox** to reference our instance.
  * **`-l`** is used to inform which Linux distribution (**debian** or **ubuntu**) configuration files we want to use (notice this is used to specify which folder under data is referenced). Default is **`debian`**.
  * **`-b`** is used to specify which **base image** should be used. This is the image name that was created on **VirtualBox** when we executed the installation steps from our [linux image](create-linux-image.md).
  * **`-s`** is used to pass a configuration file that our script will use to configure **virtual disks** on **VirtualBox**. You'll notice this is used only on the **Gluster** configuration step.
  * **`-a`** whether or not our instance **should be initialized** after it's created. Default is **`true`**.

  **Expected output:**

  ```

### Configure your local routing

You need to add a route to your local machine to access the internal network of **Virtualbox**.

```console
~$ sudo ip route add 192.168.4.0/27 via 192.168.4.30 dev vboxnet0
~$ sudo ip route add 192.168.4.32/27 via 192.168.4.62 dev vboxnet0
```

### Access the BusyBox

We need to get the **BusyBox IP** to access it via ssh

```console
~$ vboxmanage guestproperty get busybox "/VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/0/V4/IP"
```

Expected output:

```console
Value: 192.168.4.57
```

Use the returned value to access.

```cosole
~$ ssh debian@192.168.4.57
```

Expected output:

```console
Linux busybox 4.9.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.189-3+deb9u2 (2019-11-11) x86_64

```

### Configure the cluster

#### `kubeadm-config`

At this point, we need to set up our K8S cluster with its initial configuration..

The **SAN**, **Plane Control EndPoint** and **POD Subnet** information is required.

* The **Control Plane EndPoint** address was defined in the HAProxy Cluster (192.168.4.20) ([here](/documentation/haproxy-cluster.md)).
* The **SAN address** will be the same as the Control Plane EndPoint.
* The CIDR of the PODs will be the range recommended by the Flannel configuration (search for `net-conf.json` [here](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml)).

Based on the above information, we will have a [`kubeadm-config.yml`](../master/kubeadm-config.yaml) that looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterConfiguration
kubernetesVersion: stable-1.15
apiServer:
  certSANs:
  - "192.168.4.20"
controlPlaneEndpoint: "192.168.4.20:6443"
networking:
  podSubnet: 10.244.0.0/16
```

#### `kubeadm init`

The kubeadm tool is good if you need:

* A simple way for you to try out Kubernetes, possibly for the first time.
* A way for existing users to automate setting up a cluster and test their application.
* A building block in other ecosystem and/or installer tools with a larger scope.

> Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/

This approach requires less infrastructure. The etcd members and control plane nodes are co-located.

1. Run the following commands to init master node:

   ```console
   debian@busybox:~$ ssh kube-mast01

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ curl --progress-bar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvallim/kubernetes-under-the-hood/master/master/kubeadm-config.yaml -o kubeadm-config.yaml

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo kubeadm init --config=kubeadm-config.yaml --upload-certs
   ```

   Expected output:

   Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

   To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

     mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
     sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
     sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

   You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
   Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

   You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

     kubeadm join 192.168.4.20:6443 --token 5e7aaq.ejvnu55qqxst7czz \
       --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:457f6e849077f9c0a6ed8ad6517c91bfa4f48080c141dda34c3650fc3b1a99fd \
       --control-plane --certificate-key 039bae4efd18d7692139f1101fedc877f68c1b4f3a7aa247d4703a764cc98131

   Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
   As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
    "kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

   Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

   kubeadm join 192.168.4.20:6443 --token 5e7aaq.ejvnu55qqxst7czz \
       --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:457f6e849077f9c0a6ed8ad6517c91bfa4f48080c141dda34c3650fc3b1a99fd
   ```

2. Finish configuring the cluster and query the state of nodes and pods

   ```console
   debian@kube-mast01:~$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console
   NAME          STATUS     ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                       KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
   kube-mast01   NotReady   master   53s   v1.15.6   192.168.1.72   <none>        Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)   4.9.0-11-amd64   docker://18.6.0
   ```

   ```console

   ```

> If you look at the status on the `kube-mast01` node, it says it is **NotReady** and the `coredns` pods are in the **Pending** state. This is because, up to this point, we do not have a network component configured in our K8S cluster. Remember, as explained before, Flannel will be used for this matter.

#### Deploy flannel

1. Run the following commands to init the flannel network component:

   ```console
   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/v0.11.0/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console
   clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flannel created
   clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flannel created
   serviceaccount/flannel created
   configmap/kube-flannel-cfg created
   daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-amd64 created
   daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-arm64 created
   daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-arm created
   daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-ppc64le created
   daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-s390x created
   ```

2. Query the state of the nodes and pods after flannel is deployed:

   ```console
   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console

   ```

> If you look at the status on the `kube-mast01` node, it is now **Ready** and coredns is **Running**. Also, now there is pod named `kube-flannel-ds-amd64`.

### Join Master Replicas

Now we need to join the other nodes to our K8S cluster. For this, we need the certificates that were generated in the previous steps.

#### Print Certificate Key

1. Run the following commands to copy certificates to master replicas:

   ```console
   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console
   I0126 20:48:17.259139    5983 version.go:248] remote version is much newer: v1.17.2; falling back to: stable-1.15
   [upload-certs] Storing the certificates in Secret "kubeadm-certs" in the "kube-system" Namespace
   [upload-certs] Using certificate key:

   ```

   Now we'll use the certificate key `f385dc122fcaefb52a2c9c748b399b502026ac1c8134cb9b9aa79144d004d95c`

#### Print the Join Command

1. Run the following command to print the join command. This will be used to join the other master replicas to the cluster:

   ```console
   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console
   kubeadm join 192.168.4.20:6443 --token uziz9q.5n9r0rbempgyupvg --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:457f6e849077f9c0a6ed8ad6517c91bfa4f48080c141dda34c3650fc3b1a99fd
   ```

#### Join the second Kube Master

1. Run the following commands to join the second master replica to cluster using the join command printed in the previous section:

   debian@kube-mast02:~$ sudo kubeadm join 192.168.4.20:6443 \
      --token uziz9q.5n9r0rbempgyupvg \
      --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:457f6e849077f9c0a6ed8ad6517c91bfa4f48080c141dda34c3650fc3b1a99fd \
      --certificate-key f385dc122fcaefb52a2c9c748b399b502026ac1c8134cb9b9aa79144d004d95c \
      --control-plane
   ```

#### Join third Kube Master

1. Run the following commands to join the third master replica to cluster using the join command printed in the previous section:

   ```console
   debian@busybox:~$ ssh kube-mast03

   debian@kube-mast03:~$ sudo kubeadm join 192.168.4.20:6443 \
      --token uziz9q.5n9r0rbempgyupvg \
      --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:457f6e849077f9c0a6ed8ad6517c91bfa4f48080c141dda34c3650fc3b1a99fd \
      --certificate-key f385dc122fcaefb52a2c9c748b399b502026ac1c8134cb9b9aa79144d004d95c \
      --control-plane
   ```

### Check the etcd status

1. Query the etcd state

   At this point we will use images from `etcd` with the `etcdctl` cli, using the certificates generated in the previous step of initializing `master-node`.

   **Command**  
   **`cluster-health`** check the health of the etcd cluster  
   **`member`** member `add`, `remove` and `list` subcommands  

   **Glocal Options**  
   **`--endpoints`** a comma-delimited list of machine addresses in the cluster (default: "127.0.0.1:4001,127.0.0.1:2379")  
   **`--cert-file`** identify HTTPS client using this SSL certificate file  
   **`--key-file`** identify HTTPS client using this SSL key file  
   **`--ca-file`** verify certificates of HTTPS-enabled servers using this CA bundle  

   For more details of the `etcdctl` parameters see: http://manpages.org/etcdctl

   ```console
   debian@busybox:~$ ssh kube-mast01

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo docker run --rm -it \
       --net host \
       -v /etc/kubernetes:/etc/kubernetes quay.io/coreos/etcd:v3.2.24 etcdctl \
       --cert-file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt \
       --key-file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key \
       --ca-file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
       --endpoints https://127.0.0.1:2379 cluster-health

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ sudo docker run --rm -it \
       --net host \
       -v /etc/kubernetes:/etc/kubernetes quay.io/coreos/etcd:v3.2.24 etcdctl \
       --cert-file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt \
       --key-file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key \
       --ca-file /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
       --endpoints https://127.0.0.1:2379 member list
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console
   member 5c81b5ea448e2eb is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.1.72:2379
   member 1d7ec3729980eebe is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.1.68:2379
   member ea93a1a33cffaceb is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.1.81:2379
   ```

   ```console
   5c81b5ea448e2eb: name=kube-mast01 peerURLs=https://192.168.1.72:2380 clientURLs=https://192.168.1.72:2379 isLeader=false

   ea93a1a33cffaceb: name=kube-mast03 peerURLs=https://192.168.1.81:2380 clientURLs=https://192.168.1.81:2379 isLeader=false
   ```

### Check the K8S Cluster stats

1. Query the state of nodes and pods

   ```console
   debian@busybox:~$ ssh kube-mast01

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

   debian@kube-mast01:~$ kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```console
   NAME          STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                       KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
